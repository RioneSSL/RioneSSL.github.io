### 余談 Digression
- 台風14号の影響で公共交通機関の計画運休のため予定通りに帰ることができず、延泊を余儀なくされました。
- また、ロボットの運搬についても心配されましたがなんとかホテルまで無事に戻ることができました。
- 台風の被害はなく、延泊の後時間のある人たちで愛知観光（？）を楽しんで帰りました！
- Due to typhoon No. 14, we were unable to return as planned due to the planned suspension of public transportation, so we had to extend our stay.
- Also, we were worried about the transportation of the robot, but we managed to return to the hotel safely.
- There was no damage from the typhoon.

## まとめ　construction
- 今後はしばらく大会の予定がないので、実験しながらロボットの改良をしていきたいと思います。
- We don't have any plans for competitions for a while, so We would like to improve the robot while experimenting.
- バイバイ👋
- bye-bye
